<p>Baking is truly an art, a combination of both expertly combined ingredients and technique. For success in the kitchen, it‚Äôs crucial to master essential baking techniques, but also understand the ingredients you‚Äôre working with. At the start of each month, bakers will receive a custom baking lesson. Each module will feature a crave-worthy recipe with a corresponding ingredient breakdown, tutorial, and step-by-step images that demonstrate every technique used in the recipe. Within a year, you‚Äôll accumulate a vast array of skills‚Äîfrom bread to pastry to cake‚Äîand graduate as a stronger, more well-rounded home baker armed with better baking knowledge and a collection of 12 epic recipes.</p>
<p>The best part? Baking School In-Depth is free! We‚Äôve even created a Facebook group where you can share your bakes and join the Bake from Scratch baking community </p>
